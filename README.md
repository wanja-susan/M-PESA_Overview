# M-PESA_Overview
Explore my M-Pesa Financial Overview 2023 repository, where data analysis meets financial insights. 

As the data analyst for my latest project, I embarked on a journey to transform a messy and inconsistent M-Pesa statement dataset from September 2022 to September 2023 into a valuable financial dashboard. Here's a glimpse into my process:

# Data Cleaning
In refining the M-Pesa dataset, 
* I transitioned dates from their full format to a concise three-word representation.
* Negative values were converted to positives using the ABS formula, ensuring accurate financial representation.
* I filled blank cells with zero, ensuring accurate calculations and a clean dataset.
* Superfluous columns were removed, honing in on vital metrics. Within the 'Details' column, specific information was replaced, fostering uniformity and enhancing readability.
*  Paramount was the removal of personal data, ensuring privacy and compliance.
     This streamlined process transformed raw data into a precise, actionable foundation for insightful financial analysis. Welcome to a world where clarity meets data-driven decisions

# Structured Data
With clean data in hand, I structured it to have consistent columns for Receipt No.	Completion Time,	Date,	Month, Month_	, Day, Details,	Transaction Status,	Paid In,	Withdraw1	Balance

creating a solid foundation for analysis.
* Receipt No.: A unique identifier assigned to a financial transaction or purchase for tracking and reference purposes.
* Completion Time: The specific time when a transaction is successfully finished or accomplished.
* Date: A specific calendar day, represented in numerical format (MM/DD/YYYY) indicating when a transaction occurred.
* Month: A unit of time, usually ranging from 28 to 31 days, representing a division of the year. 
* Day: A specific calendar day within a month, represented numerically.
* Details: Additional information or description related to a transaction, providing context or specifying what the transaction pertains to.
* Transaction Status: Indicates the current state of a transaction, such as "Completed," "Pending," or "Failed," indicating whether the transaction was successful or not.
* Paid In: The amount of money that has been deposited or paid into an account or during a transaction.
* Withdrawal: The process of taking money out of an account, typically recorded as a negative value indicating an outgoing transaction.
* Balance: The remaining amount of money in an account after all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) have been accounted for. It represents the financial status of the account at a specific point in time.

# Pivot Tables
Pivot tables became my trusty tool for summarizing and grouping data. I used them to break down transactions by categories like midcity expenses, airtime purchases, Lakers expenses, and more, gaining insights into spending patterns.

# Pivot Charts
To bring the data to life, I harnessed the power of pivot charts. They allowed me to create dynamic visualizations that showcased trends, and most importantly how I spent money over the year.

# Interactive Dashboard
Finally, I combined all these elements into a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard not only provided a comprehensive view of my financial journey but also allowed for interactive exploration of the data by use of a slicer.
